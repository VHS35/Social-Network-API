SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Description
Building a web API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Express.js was used for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. Currently working on debugging the reaction route.
